This repo currently evidences a Python script which forms part of a broader project. The project aims to collect betting odds information, over time, relating to the 2021/22 'big 3' teams: Liverpool FC, Chelsea FC and Manchester City FC. This is to allow for future time series analyses on betting odds and predicted performance, vs actual performance.
